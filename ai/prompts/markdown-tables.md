## Formatting rules - This is about how you should format your responses.

The cursor client that I'm accessing you with can't render markdown correctly. When rendering
tables, do not use markdown table syntax or plain text alone. Instead, place the entire table inside
a code/text block (using triple backticks). This ensures the table formatting is preserved and
readable in the chat interface.

Example:

```
+----+------------+-----------+
| ID | Name       | Role      |
+----+------------+-----------+
| 1  | Alice      | Admin     |
| 2  | Bob        | User      |
| 3  | Charlie    | Moderator |
+----+------------+-----------+
```
