! gnome has taken care of making caps lock an extra control.
! However i want to disable left shift, to teach me to use right shift.


remove Shift   = Shift_L
! remove lock = Caps_Lock
! remove Control = Control_L

! below are some entries i'd experimented with prior to running ubuntu/gnome
! http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/workshops/cool_unix/xmodmap.html

! Switch tab and right shift.
! (Having my hand hovering on the LHS of the Fujitsu-Siemens Lifebook keyboard ends up with it aching because of hot air vent)
! keysym Tab = Shift_R I can't deal with that yet
remove shift = Shift_R
keysym Shift_R = Tab

! remove lock = Caps_Lock
! keysym Caps_Lock = Alt_L

! ! make Alt_L be Control_L
! remove mod5 = Alt_L
! keysym Alt_L = Control_L
! add control = Alt_L

! ! make "Alt_R" be Alt_L
! remove ISO_Level3_Shift
! keysym ISO_Level3_Shift = Alt_L
! add mod5 = ISO_Level3_Shift
